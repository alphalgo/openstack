> BE KNOWN: CODE IN HERE JUST TRIAL FOR MY PERSONAL STUDY, ACTUALLY SOME STUFF MAKE NO SENSE AND NO VALIDATE, SO DON'T USE IT EXCEPT YOU OWN RISK. AND I AM A FRESHBIRD FOR GO, MAYBE YOU WANT TO HELP ME TO MAKE PROMOTION, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

Here are some codes I wirte it for intresting without test, maybe the code itself full of errors, so don't expect much more, I will update it when I bring a new thought. Totally, that was awesome, I'd like to do it.

Eh, maybe I forget somthing, all of these code source from my another project [p0ints](https://github.com/i0Ek3/p0ints). If you want to know more details, please see that introduction, but not for all.

Here the thought: [https://github.com/i0Ek3/p0ints/blob/master/p0ints/2020.0828-openstack.md](https://github.com/i0Ek3/p0ints/blob/master/p0ints/2020.0828-openstack.md). But I added something small to it, expansion on the way, slowly.
